    """Create a new interaction log entry, acting as an anti-corruption layer between API DTO and DB model.

    Why: Translates Pydantic DTO to SQLAlchemy model explicitly to prevent TypeErrors from mismatched fields,
    ensuring robustness against schema evolutions (e.g., added DTO fields ignored). Computes payload_hash for
    idempotency, maps details to agent_support JSONB for flexible resilience data, discards session_id as irrelevant
    to persistence, and sets emitted_at_utc for required timestamping. Aligns with Martin Clean Code for explicit
    intent, Fowler refactoring for evolvable layers, and Pragmatic Programmer defensive programming to eliminate
    similar bugs proactively. Supports AI trust fabric by maintaining data integrity for agentic logs.
