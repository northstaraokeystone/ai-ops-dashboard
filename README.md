## The Problem

Fragmented incident response across many tools slows Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and leaves AI agent actions unaudited and hard to explain, blocking compliance and trust in autonomous systems. When an agent fails, teams are left scrambling between observability platforms, ticketing systems, and runbook automators, wasting critical time while risks compound.

## The Solution

**TruthRun** provides a unified **"Trust Command Center"** that brings together incident triage, automated diagnosis, and one-click remediation in a single, agent-aware surface. Built as an open-source platform, it provides a verifiable, immutable ledger for every agentic action and a simple Python SDK to make your agents resilient and observable in minutes.

This reduces resolution time, enhances auditability, and builds deep, provable trust in your agentic workforce.

## Core Features

*   **Verifiable Ledger:** Log every agentic action to an immutable, time-series ledger, ready for audit and analysis.
*   **Interactive Triage:** A single command center to investigate, assign ownership, and manage the lifecycle of incidents.
*   **Automated Remediation:** Execute pre-defined, version-controlled playbooks with one click directly from the UI.
*   **Python SDK:** A simple, clean SDK to integrate TruthRun's resilience and observability capabilities into any AI agent in under 5 minutes.

## Getting Started

To get the TruthRun stack running locally for development:

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/northstaraokeystone/ai-ops-dashboard.git
cd ai-ops-dashboard
