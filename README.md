# AI Trust Fabric
### The Governance Engine for Production AI

**We transform chaos into sacred order. Uncertainty to trust. Potential to power.**

This repository contains the V1.0 implementation of the AI Trust Fabric, an open-source framework for the economic and ethical governance of machine learning systems. This is not just a monitoring tool; it is a **Decision Integrity Platform.**

### The Problem: Broken Decisions
The world is built on decisions. As AI automates more of them, the cost of a broken decision multiplies. 78% of production ML models degrade silently, leading to millions in unquantified losses, compliance risks, and eroded trust. Existing tools monitor technical metrics; they do not govern economic or ethical outcomes.

**We are rewriting the playbook.**

### The Three Pillars of Trust (The V1.0 Modules)

This system is built on a three-layer trust stack, demonstrated through three core modules:

**1. Integrity (Trust the Input)**
-   **Mantra:** "Garbage in → litigation out."
-   **Function:** Quantifies data health before it ever reaches a model, providing a 0-100 Data Trust Index and actionable remediation steps.

**2. Explainability (Trust the Logic)**
-   **Mantra:** "You can't optimize what you can't explain."
-   **Function:** Analyzes model training logs to translate hyperparameter choices into GPU costs and operational efficiency.

**3. Sustainability (Trust the Lifecycle)**
-   **Mantra:** "Retrain for reason, not for vibes."
-   **Function:** Simulates model decay over time, translating performance drift into a dollar figure to provide a clear, economic trigger for when to retrain.

The Vision: AGI-Adjacent Governance
This project is the first step towards a larger vision: building the constitutional framework for autonomous AI. As AI moves from tools to agents, our role shifts from monitoring to governance—setting the economic, ethical, and operational boundaries within which AI is permitted to optimize.

Values
Keep it Clear: Simple. Strategic. Focused.
Keep it True: Integrity. Accuracy. Fidelity.
Keep it Real: Authentic. Genuine. Raw.
Keep it Bold: Disruptive. Courageous. Contagious.
Keep it Human: Humble. Creative. Compassionate.
Keep it Sacred: Authoritative. Transcendent. Infinite.

This project is an artifact of my work at the W. P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, MS AIB.

MVP is live.
